Here is Dataset. Electric power consumption [20Mb]

#The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

1.Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
2.Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
3.Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
4.Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
5.Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
6.Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
7.Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
8.Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
9.Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

Problem
In plot3 and plot4, legend in PNG file is cut off...please look at my PNG file. In window screen, there is no problem at legend, but when I save images, problem happens. I think problem appears when setting images for certain size.
